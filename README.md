# PA-UE-Chat-Autofill
 
The PA unemployment chat is overloaded and I've had a hard time getting in, so I created a simple script that will submit in a loop until the chat is not automatically ended by the system. 

## How to use
Navigate to the PA unemployment chat page. https://www.uc.pa.gov/Chat/index.aspx

To use, simply copy and paste the JS from the autofiller.js, enter your details into the variabes, and paste into your browser's JS console.
